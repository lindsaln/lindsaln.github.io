<h1>Logan Lindsay</h1>
<p>Computer Engineering Student</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Logan Lindsay and I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelors of Computer Engineering at the University of Cincinnati. I enjoy getting involved in student organizations across the university. These experiences allow me to network and interact with students, employers, and faculty from many different backgrounds. More information on my student involvment can be found in the involvment section below.</p>
<p>Thus far, I have currently completed two co-op rotations with London Computer Systems. I spent my first rotation working as a Quality Assurance Co-op and the second rotation as a Software Developer Co-op. My experience as a Peer Leader gave me the ability to develope new skills such as learning to be adjustable to best fit the needs of students, being an effective leader, and time management. As the Career Fair Coordinator for the College of Engineering and Applied Science Tribunal, I have been able to interact with university staff, faculty, employers, and students from other colleges to create employment opportunities for thousands of students across many disciplines. I will be spending my last 3 Co-op rotations at Siemens PLM Software.</p>
