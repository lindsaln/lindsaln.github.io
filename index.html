                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Logan Lindsay and I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelors of Computer Engineering at the <a class="regular-link" href="https://uc.edu" target="_blank">University of Cincinnati</a>. I enjoy getting involved in student organizations across the university. These experiences allow me to network and interact with students, employers, and faculty from many different backgrounds. More information on my student involvement can be found in the involvement section below.</p>
                    <p>Thus far, I have currently completed two co-op rotations with <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.lcs.com/" target="_blank">London Computer Systems</a>. I spent my first rotation working as a Quality Assurance Co-op and the second rotation as a Software Developer Co-op. During those rotations I had the opportunity to work with development tools such as Perforce and Visual Studio. My experience as a <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.uc.edu/learningcommons/learning-communities/pl.html" target="_blank">Peer Leader</a> gave me the ability to develope new skills such as learning to be adjustable to best fit the needs of students, being an effective leader, and time management. I will be spending my last 3 Co-op rotations at <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/" target="_blank">Siemens PLM Software</a>.</p>
                    <p>To reach out, please contact me at <a class="regular-link" href="mailto:lindsaln@mail.uc.edu">lindsaln@mail.uc.edu.</a>.</p>
